# Map Data Across the Globe

The purpose of the project is to show the mapping of data across the globe.

## UX

As a user, I can see where the meteorites have landed on a world map.

As a user, I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it is represented on the map.

As a user, I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.
